# grasping in bullet

a simple environment for playing with hindsight experience replay

```
# guess at deps...
pip install gym Pillow
```

```
pushd $BULLET_CHECKOUT
# hack to include PYTHON_LIBRARY
./build_cmake_pybullet_double.sh
popd
ln -s $BULLET_CHECKOUT/build_cmake/examples/pybullet/pybullet.so
ln -s $BULLET_CHECKOUT/data
```

some notes re: replaying
- if the goal at time N is a possible that the arm got to at time M (M<N) then the replayed
  episode will be over by time M, not the "full" N.
- the goal possible might put the block in a position where it stops the arm from being able to
  exactly replay the original trajectory.

e.g.

$ ./gather_rollouts.py --run r1 --agent greedy --max_steps=50 --num_episodes=10
$ ./replay_rollouts.py --run_in=r1 --run_out=r1r
$ ./episode_stats.py
